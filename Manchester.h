This code is based on the Atmel Corporation Manchester
Coding Basics Application Note.

http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc9164.pdf

Quotes from the application note:

"Manchester coding states that there will always be a transition of the message signal
at the mid-point of the data bit frame.
What occurs at the bit edges depends on the state of the previous bit frame and
does not always produce a transition. A logical '1' is defined as a mid-point transition
from low to high and a '0' is a mid-point transition from high to low.
 
We use Timing Based Manchester Decode.
In this approach we will capture the time between each transition coming from the demodulation
circuit."

Timer 2 is used with a ATMega328. Timer 1 is used for a ATtiny85 and ATtiny84

This code gives a basic data rate as 1200 bauds. In manchester encoding we send 1 0 for a data bit 0.
We send 0 1 for a data bit 1. This ensures an average over time of a fixed DC level in the TX/RX.
This is required by the ASK RF link system to ensure its correct operation.
The data rate is then 600 bits/s. Higher and lower rates are also supported.

/*
Timer 2 in the ATMega328 and Timer 1 in a ATtiny85 is used to find the time between
each transition coming from the demodulation circuit.
Their setup is for sampling the input in regular intervals.
For practical reasons we use power of 2 timer prescaller for sampling, 
for best timing we use pulse lenght as integer multiple of sampling speed.
We chose to sample every 8 ticks, and pulse lenght of 48 ticks 
thats 6 samples per pulse, lower sampling rate (3) will not work well for 
innacurate clocks (like internal oscilator) higher sampling rate (12) will
cause too much overhead and will not work at higher transmission speeds.
This gives us 16000000Hz/48/256 = 1302 pulses per second (so it's not really 1200) 
At different transmission speeds or on different microcontroller frequencies, clock prescaller is adjusted 
to be compatible with those values. We allow about 50% clock speed difference both ways
allowing us to transmit even with up to 100% in clock speed difference
